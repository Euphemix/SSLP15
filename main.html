        Su Shi (1037–1101), also known as Su Dongpo, was one of the most
        celebrated poets, essayists, and statesmen of the Song Dynasty in China.
        A towering figure in Chinese literature, Su Shi was known for his
        versatility—mastering poetry, prose, calligraphy, painting, and public
        service.<br />

        His life was marked by dramatic shifts in fortune: from high-ranking
        official positions to political exile. These personal experiences deeply
        shaped his writing, which ranges from bold patriotic expression to
        profound philosophical reflection and serene detachment.<br />

        Su Shi’s works are admired for their emotional depth, intellectual
        insight, and vivid connection to nature. His legacy continues to
        influence Chinese aesthetics, literature, and thought.<br />
