        In his later years, Su Shi was first re-employed by the court and held
        an important official position, but was later demoted to the south due
        to political struggles. When he was in Hangzhou, he cared about the
        people and built the famous Su Causeway.

        Su Shi created "Presented to Liu Jingwen", a poem he gave to his friend
        when he was exiled to Huangzhou, describing the scenery of the four
        seasons and his life interests. His creative mood is: appreciating
        nature and the four seasons, being peaceful, and integrating into the
        mountains and rivers. In terms of art, the text is concise and vivid,
        rich in painting ideas, and the language is novel and agile. The theme
        revolves around "philosophy, life realm, and tolerance", and the overall
        emotional tendency is appreciation and peace.

        Su Shi created "After a Rain at West Lake (2nd Poem of Two)" was written
        when Su Shi was working in Hangzhou. It expresses his feelings by
        describing the scenery, and reconciles government affairs and leisure.
        His creative mood is: living in the official residence, returning to the
        peaceful and carefree nature in the poetic indifference. In terms of
        art, it is based on freshness, natural language, and fresh and lively
        poetry. The theme revolves around "mountains and rivers, beauty
        comparison, and leisure", and the overall emotional tendency is calm and
        leisure.
